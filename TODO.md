# TODO.md - Chapter 3: Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms with Scikit-learn

## Objective

Develop a machine learning model to classify wheat grain varieties using physical characteristics, applying the CRISP-DM methodology.  

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze and Preprocess the Data
- [x] Create a notebook file (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter (locally) or Google Colab (cloud).
- [x] Import the "Seeds" dataset and display the first rows to understand its structure.
- [ ] Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each feature.
- [ ] Visualize feature distributions using:
  - [ ] Histograms.
  - [ ] Boxplots.
- [ ] Use scatter plots to identify relationships between features.
- [ ] Handle any missing values in the dataset.
- [ ] Assess the need for feature scaling and apply normalization or standardization if necessary.

### 2. Implement and Compare Classification Algorithms
- [ ] Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
- [ ] Choose at least three classification algorithms, such as:
  - [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  - [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - [ ] Random Forest.
  - [ ] Naive Bayes.
  - [ ] Logistic Regression.
- [ ] Train each model using the training set.
- [ ] Evaluate each model on the test set using:
  - [ ] Accuracy.
  - [ ] Precision.
  - [ ] Recall.
  - [ ] F1-score.
  - [ ] Confusion matrices.
- [ ] Compare the performance of all algorithms.

### 3. Optimize the Models (if necessary)
- [ ] Use Grid Search or Randomized Search to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.
- [ ] Retrain each model using the best-found hyperparameters.
- [ ] Re-evaluate the optimized models on the test set using:
  - [ ] Accuracy.
  - [ ] Precision.
  - [ ] Recall.
  - [ ] F1-score.
  - [ ] Confusion matrices.
- [ ] Check for significant improvements in performance.

### 4. Interpret Results and Extract Insights
- [ ] Analyze the performance of each model in detail.
- [ ] Relate the results to the wheat grain classification context.
- [ ] Summarize key insights and conclusions about the problem and the models used.
